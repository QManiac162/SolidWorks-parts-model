# SolidWorks-parts-model collection

## **Welcome Visitors!**

The current repository consists of a collection of parts modelled in a CAD or a *Computer Aided Designing* software namely

> **SOLIDWORKS**

The repository contains a stash of some commonly used engineering parts of some vehicle, maybe of some machinery or some joints. Through this collection, one can access the models directly to incorporate into their own projects for further developments

---
> afterall, CAD is the tip of the ice-berg to the complete machinery or support

This repository has been created by me to keep myself in touch with CAD and learn new designing techniques through practicing the construction of these parts. 

Hope you find the them fascinating and usefull!
